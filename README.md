The purpose of this test was to determine if there is a correlation between a person's psychological trait such as agreeableness, to the mean temperature of the country in which they live. The generated plots indicate that all "Big Five" trait scores remain constant regardless of temperature (dots are forming vertical lines). In other words, the data indicate that a country's climate does not affect the personality of its citizens. This contradicts the fact that countries with mild temperatures (not too hot nor cold) tend to have more extroverted people (higher openness score) since climate does not dictate they stay indoors for a large part of the year. Further testing is required to specify the source of this discrepancy, be it the dataset or the processing I did.
