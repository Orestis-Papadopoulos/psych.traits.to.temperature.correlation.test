The purpose of this test was to determine if there is a correlation between a person's psychological trait such as agreeableness, to the mean temperature of the country in which they live. The generated plots indicate that all "Big Five" trait scores remain constant regardless of temperature (dots are forming vertical lines). In other words, the data indicate that a country's climate does not affect the personality of its citizens.
