The purpose of this test was to determine if there is a correlation between a person's psychological trait such as agreeableness, to the mean temperature of the country in which the person lives. The plots indicate that all "Big Five" trait scores remain constant regardless of temperature. In other words, the data indicate that a country's climate does not affect the personality of citizens.
